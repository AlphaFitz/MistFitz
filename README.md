# MistFitz
Hey, my name is Fitz. Collectively, the components of the MistFitz comprise a sophisticated, high pressure aeroponics controller. User input controls mist timing. Sensors make sure proper pressures are reached before timing starts. 
My thought processes look for "silver bullet" solutions. When one action can manifest multiple positive outcomes, I am happy.
This aeroponics contrller allows production of food with 1% the water of traditional farming. By moving food out of the dirt, the majority of bug problems disappear. This also make things reachable for wheelchair bound gardeners. Additionally,  substantially less weight opens up new potential garn spaces like rooftops. This is a big one, by growing your veggies at your home, you reduce an enormous number of trips both from farms to grocery stores, and from home to grocery stores. You grow it at your home and eat it there as well. Tremendously reducing greenhouse emmissions. 
No one has ever fleshed one of these systems out properly to get systems working in a synergistic way, producing a consistent outcome.
